#Sort-the-Blocks-Puzzle

Welcome to my own Puzzle Game, where I hope you have a lot of fun playing and exploring the Game mechanics. Make sure to have a look at "#Game-Rules" and have a better understanding at the game rules.

#Game-Rules

In this puzzle game, you will be provided "blocks" of six different sizes randomly arranged at three different "stick holders". You are able to lift/grab one block from any stick, and you must place the block at either stick holders before you grab another block. But, don't just randomly those blocks, you must be aware that you are not allowed to place blocks of larger size on top of a smaller sized block. To figure out which block is the largest, and which is the smallest, you are provided with a display too. At the end of the game, once you sort all the blocks according to their size, in descending order, you can get your score/results and check how many moves you spent sorting them all. I hope you get the basics of the puzzle cleared, not have deep dive into it.

#Conclusion

• You must grab/lift one block at a time, and you must place that one block at any stick holders to proceed.
• You must not place a large sized block on top of a small sized block, only the vice versa is allowed.

Good Luck, Have Fun!
